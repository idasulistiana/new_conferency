				<h2>about SBRC</h2>
					<p align="justify">&emsp;
						Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Center (SBRC) is one of the research centers under the Research and Community Services Agency (LPPM), Bogor Agricultural University (IPB). This research center was established in June 2004 with the name of Surfactant Research and Development Center (SRDC) focusing on biobased surfactants. After the establishment of SRDC, issues on energy crisis and climate change were arising and triggered the center to take part in bioenergy-related research and development. The name of the center was then changed into Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Center (SBRC) in 2006.

					<p align="justify">&emsp;
						Surfactant development research consists of processing and technology development research, followed by application of the product in various industries. Bioenergy development research contains integrated upstream to downstream research activities. These activities include breeding and cultivation technique of bioenergy crops; process and technology; role model of institutional development on bioenergy business; dissemination, and promotion. The recent major bioenergy crops to develop are superior Jatropha curcas Linn for biodiesel, unedible cassava for bioethanol and micro/macroalgae as the next alternative environmentally friendly biofuel feedstock.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">&emsp;
						Surfactant application and developments are focused on Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), Improved Oil Recovery (IOR), oil spill dispersants, herbicide and insecticide formulation. In the future research on bioenergy will be focused on biomass conversion from agriculture waste and bioavtur development from CPO base.
